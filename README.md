### I'm Saud (he/him), a coder with a passion for creation.

**Currently looking for New Grad SWE positions. Feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn below.**

When I first started coding- I knew it was for me. 
I love being able to express my creativity through the code I write and love to find awesome solutions to unique problems! </br></br>
That's why I can't stop learning- if there's an idea in my head, I'll do whatever it takes to bring it to fruition, even if that means learning a new language or framework. </br>
